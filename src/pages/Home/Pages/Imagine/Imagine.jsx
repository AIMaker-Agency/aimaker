    <p>Human family<br/><br/>
    We can start by saying that the human family is a concept that emphasizes the unity and interdependence of all human beings. Indeed, we are all members of this great family and we share the same destiny. In this context, it is essential to consider each individual as a full member of this family and to promote their autonomy.<br/><br/>
    Indeed, individual autonomy is the key to organizing collective intelligence. By enabling each individual to develop their own skills and pursue their own goals, we create fertile ground for the creation of knowledge and innovation. This is why it is important to promote reverse inclusion, that is to say, to give populations considered “excluded” the means to acquire the knowledge and technologies necessary to become autonomous and to become transmitters of innovations.<br/><br/>
    However, for this organization of collective intelligence based on individual autonomy to work, it is necessary to have a standard and its application. Indeed, a norm is a set of rules or principles that govern individual and collective behavior. If these standards are well defined and enforced, they can help create an environment conducive to autonomy and creativity.<br/><br/>
    Implement measurement tools to quantify the time, energy and impact of personal and collective actions, with the aim of promoting transparency in the knowledge and innovation economy. This approach will promote cooperation and individual involvement for collective action, allowing the actors involved to better understand the effectiveness of their actions and to collaborate more effectively to achieve common objectives.<br/><br/>
    Ultimately, the goal is to create a family setting in which individuals can craft their own social contract before taking action. For this, we must develop personal and collective strategies of disruption, such as hacking, DIY, personal development, complex thinking, singularity, a scientific approach and recognition of diversity. By encouraging these values ​​and attitudes, we can create an ecosystem favorable to the knowledge economy and to the organization of collective intelligence based on individual autonomy.</p>
